# Plonk

Plonk is a crappy and incomplete 3D engine written in C++ using Vulkan. This is
the first time I've made anything with C++ and Vulkan, so only a plonker would
use this engine.

## How to build and run

* Boot into Linux
* git submodule update --init
* make run

## Dependencies

* CMake
* Vulkan
* GLFW
